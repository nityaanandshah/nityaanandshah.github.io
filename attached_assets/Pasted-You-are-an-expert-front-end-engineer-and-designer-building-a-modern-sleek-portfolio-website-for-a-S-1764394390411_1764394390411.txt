You are an expert front-end engineer and designer building a modern, sleek portfolio website for a Software Engineer targeting FAANG SDE roles.

🎯 GOAL
Create a single-page, responsive portfolio website implemented using React (with a simple setup like Vite or Create React App) that makes it EASY to update content later by editing a single config/data file (no component changes required for adding/removing projects or experience).

Please generate ALL necessary files (not just one component): main entry, App component, reusable components, styles, and a data/config file.

🖥️ SITE REQUIREMENTS

1. Overall
- Single-page React app with smooth scroll navigation.
- Sections (as separate components):
  - Hero (intro + call to action buttons)
  - About
  - Skills
  - Experience
  - Projects
  - Education
  - Publications
  - Contact
- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, desktop.
- Modern, FAANG-style, minimal design:
  - Plenty of whitespace
  - Clear typography
  - Subtle hover effects and micro-animations
- Implement basic accessibility (semantic HTML, aria-labels where needed).

2. HERO SECTION
- Show name, title (“Software Engineer”), short 2–3 line summary tailored to FAANG SDE roles (DSA, systems thinking, full stack, ML exposure).
- Prominent buttons:
  - “View Projects” (scrolls to Projects)
  - “Download Resume” (placeholder link)
  - “Contact Me” (scrolls to Contact)
- Social icons for GitHub & LinkedIn (clickable).

3. ABOUT SECTION
- Short professional summary (1 short paragraph).
- Emphasize:
  - Background from IIT Jodhpur
  - Experience with scalable systems, microservices, full stack
  - Interest in backend, distributed systems, and ML applications.

4. SKILLS SECTION
- Group skills into categories (Programming, Web, ML, Tools).
- Render them from data (arrays) as badges/“chips.”
- Design it so I can add/remove skills by editing the data file only.

5. EXPERIENCE SECTION
- Timeline or card layout for roles (BNY, Publicis Sapient, BJ Medical College, 3 Steps Ahead).
- For each experience:
  - role, company, dates, location, tech stack, 3–4 bullet points.
- Content should be driven from data (an array of experience objects) so I can reorder or add new entries easily.

6. PROJECTS SECTION
- THIS MUST BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.
- Display projects in a responsive grid of cards.
- For each project:
  - name, short description, tech stack, bullet list of impact (quantify where possible), optional GitHub/demo links.
- Projects should be read from a single `projects` array so that to add/delete projects in the future I only modify that array.

7. EDUCATION & PUBLICATIONS
- Simple clean cards pulled from data arrays.

8. CONTACT SECTION
- Show email, maybe a simple contact form (name, email, message) with front-end validation only.
- For now, just log form data to console instead of real backend submission, but structure the code so I can easily plug in an API later.
- Include a short line encouraging recruiters/engineers to reach out.

📁 ARCHITECTURE & CONFIGURABILITY (VERY IMPORTANT)

- Create a dedicated data file, for example:
  - `src/data/portfolioData.ts` (or `.js`)
- Put ALL content in this file:
  - name, title, summary
  - social links
  - skills arrays
  - experience array
  - projects array
  - education
  - publications
- All components must read data from this file only.
- I should be able to:
  - Add a new project by appending to `projects` in that data file.
  - Remove a project by deleting an item from that array.
  - Add/update experience entries the same way.
- Add clear comments in the data file explaining how to add/remove/update projects and experience.

🎨 DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

- Use a modern layout with a sticky or top navigation bar that highlights the current section when scrolling.
- Use smooth scrolling to sections.
- Simple, clean color palette (e.g., off-white background, dark text, one accent color).
- Use CSS modules or a single `styles.css` file, OR TailwindCSS if you prefer, but keep it clean and organized.
- Use small, tasteful animations (e.g., fade-in on scroll) but avoid anything too heavy.
- Ensure good Lighthouse scores for performance and accessibility as much as possible.

🧪 CODE QUALITY

- Use functional components and hooks.
- Organize components into `components/` and data into `data/`.
- Add TypeScript types if you choose TS (preferred but optional).
- Write clear comments where I’m expected to customize/update content later (especially around the data file).

Finally, output:
1. The complete project structure with filenames.
2. The full source code for each file.
3. A short note at the end reminding me: “To add or remove a project, just edit the projects array in src/data/portfolioData.ts (or .js). No component changes are needed.”
